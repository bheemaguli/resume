<summary><b>1. PO data extract and report generate with RPA</b></summary>
<br>

_UiPath, Python, VB.Net, Regex_

_Nov 2021 - Jan 2022_

Aim: Extract product details from PO and update the database
Process:

- Download mail attachment with specific subject
- Generate Excel file with specific column format and sheets, generate folder and log to file with python
- Extract product data of table from PDFs (table configuration varies from customer to customer) and filter data with vb.net and regex in UiPath.
- Generate an Excel report with python using extraction data.
- Email the Report Excel after completion.

Outcome: Process 40k products a day with >90% efficiency and reduced 8 member equivalent manual labor cost.

<br>

_Engineering Final Year Project_

_Mar 2021 - Aug 2021_

- After going through numerous research papers published in the past 8 years, it was found that there lacked a design that incorporates all the latest technology in a single controller unit.
- Our team was successful in developing a design that incorporated Fuzzy-PI hybrid logic for velocity controller and FOC-SVPWM algorithm for current control.
- The model was created, tweaked and optimized for optimal speed control of the BLDC motor in Simulink.

<br>

_Engineering Final Year Project_

_Dec 2019 - Feb 2020_

- To understand the underlying concepts of EVs, an ICE vehicle was electrified.
- The vehicle was modified to use a 1KW BLDC motor and 10Ah Li-ion battery with appropriate modifications to the vehicle chassis.
- The end product was able to deliver good performance with a range of 15 Kms and recorded a top speed of 62.8 kmph.
