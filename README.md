<summary><b>1. PO data extract and report generate with RPA</b></summary>
<br>

*UiPath, Python, VB.Net, Regex*

*Nov 2021 - Jan 2022*

Aim: Extract product details from PO and update the database
Process:
* Download mail attachment with specific subject
* Generate Excel file with specific column format and sheets, generate folder and log to file with python
* Extract product data of table from PDFs (table configuration varies from customer to customer) and filter data with vb.net and regex in UiPath.
* Generate an Excel report with python using extraction data.
* Email the Report Excel after completion.

Outcome: Process 40k products a day with >90% efficiency and reduced 8 member equivalent manual labor cost.

<summary><b>4. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15Ds42YUpZaFY9qWuqYhXlFoyxCseWCql/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107321296866101467124&rtpof=true&sd=true">Hybrid Speed Controller for BLDC Motor</a></b></summary>
<br>

*Engineering Final Year Project*

*Mar 2021 - Aug 2021*

* After going through numerous research papers published in the past 8 years, it was found that there lacked a design that incorporates all the latest technology in a single controller unit. 
* Our team was successful in developing a design that incorporated Fuzzy-PI hybrid logic for velocity controller and FOC-SVPWM algorithm for current control. 
* The model was created, tweaked and optimized for optimal speed control of the BLDC motor in Simulink.

<summary><b>5. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZSFhdfa_s99KiOhDXqg7qajt0Scr3VkG2Zj4fpJVma4/edit?usp=sharing">Conversion of ICE two-wheeler to an Electric Bike</a></b></summary>
<br>

*Engineering Final Year Project*

*Dec 2019 - Feb 2020*

* To understand the underlying concepts of EVs, an ICE vehicle was electrified. 
* The vehicle was modified to use a 1KW BLDC motor and 10Ah Li-ion battery with appropriate modifications to the vehicle chassis. 
* The end product was able to deliver good performance with a range of 15 Kms and recorded a top speed of 62.8 kmph.
